# Names

This is the React front-end of a simple web application that lists names and their amounts from server. Names can be ordered by amount, most popular first, or alphabetically by name. You can also find the amount of a specific name by typing it in the input field or clear all filters and go back to the inital state. At the end of the page there is also the total amout of all the names.

The back-end can be found in the repo [namesbackend](https://github.com/hannayj/namesbackend). 

In order to run the app in development mode
1. Clone both repos.
2. Start server: npm run dev
3. Start front-end: npm start

The application is also in [Heroku](https://mighty-earth-09954.herokuapp.com).
